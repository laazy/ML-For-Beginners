# Machine Learning for Beginners - A Curriculum  

> 🌍 Travel around the world as we explore Machine Learning through world cultures 🌍  

Microsoft's Cloud Advocates are excited to present a 12-week, 26-lesson curriculum focused on **Machine Learning**. This curriculum introduces you to **classic machine learning**, primarily using the Scikit-learn library, while avoiding deep learning (covered in our [AI for Beginners' curriculum](https://aka.ms/ai4beginners)). Pair these lessons with our ['Data Science for Beginners' curriculum](https://aka.ms/ds4beginners) for a comprehensive learning experience!  

Join us on a journey around the globe as we apply these techniques to datasets from various regions. Each lesson includes pre- and post-lesson quizzes, step-by-step instructions, solutions, assignments, and more. Our project-based approach ensures you learn by building, a proven method for retaining new skills.  

**✍️ Special thanks to our authors** Jen Looper, Stephen Howell, Francesca Lazzeri, Tomomi Imura, Cassie Breviu, Dmitry Soshnikov, Chris Noring, Anirban Mukherjee, Ornella Altunyan, Ruth Yakubu, and Amy Boyd  

**🎨 Thanks to our illustrators** Tomomi Imura, Dasani Madipalli, and Jen Looper  

**🙏 Special thanks 🙏 to our Microsoft Student Ambassador authors, reviewers, and contributors**, including Rishit Dagli, Muhammad Sakib Khan Inan, Rohan Raj, Alexandru Petrescu, Abhishek Jaiswal, Nawrin Tabassum, Ioan Samuila, and Snigdha Agarwal  

**🤩 Extra gratitude to Microsoft Student Ambassadors Eric Wanjau, Jasleen Sondhi, and Vidushi Gupta for our R lessons!**  

# Getting Started  

Follow these steps:  
1. **Fork the Repository**: Click the "Fork" button at the top-right corner of this page.  
2. **Clone the Repository**: `git clone https://github.com/microsoft/ML-For-Beginners.git`  

> [Find additional resources for this course in our Microsoft Learn collection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/collections/qrqzamz1nn2wx3?WT.mc_id=academic-77952-bethanycheum)  

**[Students](https://aka.ms/student-page)**, to use this curriculum, fork the entire repo to your GitHub account and complete the exercises individually or in groups:  

- Start with a pre-lecture quiz.  
- Read the lecture and complete the activities, pausing to reflect at each knowledge check.  
- Try building the projects by understanding the lessons rather than running the solution code (available in the `/solution` folders for project-based lessons).  
- Take the post-lecture quiz.  
- Complete the challenge.  
- Finish the assignment.  
- After completing a lesson group, visit the [Discussion Board](https://github.com/microsoft/ML-For-Beginners/discussions) and "learn out loud" by filling out the appropriate PAT rubric. A 'PAT' (Progress Assessment Tool) is a rubric to further your learning. You can also engage with other PATs to learn collaboratively.  

> For further study, we recommend exploring these [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/users/jenlooper-2911/collections/k7o7tg1gp306q4?WT.mc_id=academic-77952-leestott) modules and learning paths.  

**Teachers**, we have [included some suggestions](for-teachers.md) on how to use this curriculum.

## Pedagogy  

This curriculum is built on two pedagogical principles: hands-on **project-based learning** and **frequent quizzes**. Additionally, it follows a common **theme** for cohesion.  

By aligning content with projects, the learning process becomes more engaging, and concept retention improves. Low-stakes quizzes before a class set the student's intention for learning, while post-class quizzes reinforce retention. This curriculum is designed to be flexible and enjoyable, allowing students to take it in full or in part. Projects start small and grow in complexity over the 12-week cycle. A postscript on real-world ML applications is included for extra credit or discussion.  

> Find our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md), and [Translation](TRANSLATIONS.md) guidelines. We welcome your constructive feedback!  

## Each lesson includes  

- Optional sketchnote  
- Optional supplemental video  
- Video walkthrough (some lessons only)  
- [Pre-lecture warmup quiz](https://ff-quizzes.netlify.app/en/ml/)  
- Written lesson  
- Step-by-step guides for project-based lessons  
- Knowledge checks  
- A challenge  
- Supplemental reading  
- Assignment  
- [Post-lecture quiz](https://ff-quizzes.netlify.app/en/ml/)  

> **A note about languages**: Lessons are primarily written in Python, but many are also available in R. To complete an R lesson, go to the `/solution` folder and look for R lessons. These include an `.rmd` extension, representing **R Markdown** files. R Markdown combines code chunks (R or other languages), a YAML header (for formatting outputs like PDFs), and Markdown text. It’s an excellent framework for data science, allowing you to integrate code, output, and commentary. R Markdown documents can be rendered into formats like PDF, HTML, or Word.  

> **A note about quizzes**: All quizzes are in the [Quiz App folder](../../quiz-app), totaling 52 quizzes with three questions each. They are linked within lessons but can also be run locally. Follow the instructions in the `quiz-app` folder to host locally or deploy to Azure.
